# Fake-News-Detection-using-Na-ve-Bayes
The goal in this project is to perform Fake News Detection: classifying news articles as fake or real.

Sentiment analysis can be used to extract people’s opinions about all sorts of things
(tweets, speeches, reviews, blogs) and at many levels of granularity (the sentence, the paragraph, the entire
document). the goal in this task is to look at a news story and classify it as fake or real.

1. I have implemented Boolean Na¨ıve Bayes and Multinomial Na¨ıve Bayes
2. Train a Na¨ıve Bayes classifier on the data set provided
3. Preprocess the negations in the dataset
4. Experiment with/without using stop words
5. During testing evaluated them using Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 measures
